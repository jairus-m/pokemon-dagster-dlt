"""
This module demonstrates how to use the dlt library within the Dagster framework (without the official integration)
to materialize multiple assets from three different endpoints of the PokeAPI REST API.

The example is adapted from dltHub's REST API Source tutorial:
https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/rest-api

Key features:
- Uses Dagster's @multi_asset decorator to define a single asset function that materializes three distinct assets
  (pokemon, berry, location) from a single dlt pipeline run.
- Each asset corresponds to a specific endpoint/resource in the PokeAPI.
- Asset metadata (keys, descriptions) is configured for visibility in the Dagster UI.
- Data is loaded into a DuckDB database using dlt.

Note: Adding extra comments for instruction/demo purposes.

    Loads data from three endpoints of the PokeAPI using dlt and materializes them as separate Dagster assets.

    Steps:
    1. Initializes a dlt pipeline that targets a DuckDB database. The pipeline name determines the output .duckdb file.
    2. Configures a dlt REST API source to pull data from the /pokemon, /berry, and /location endpoints with a high limit.
    3. Runs the pipeline (which fetches and loads the data into the DuckDB destination).
    4. Returns a separate Dagster Output for each resource, matching the order of the resources in the source config.

    Returns:
        Tuple[Output, Output, Output]: Dagster Output objects for pokemon, berry, and location assets, respectively.
