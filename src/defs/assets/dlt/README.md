## **Approach Comparison: dlt + Dagster Integration Patterns**

Typically, a `README.md` is not necessarily included in the `defs/` directory but for this demo/project, I'm adding it to reinforce and outline the difference between the three different patterns for using dlt and Dagster to load in mulitple endpoints from a single REST API source as multi-assets.

### **1. Basic dlt Wrapper (Non-Integrated)**

`1_poke_rest_apy.py`

```python
@dg.multi_asset  # Manual asset definition
def load_pokemon_1():
    """
    Lightweight Dagster "integration" pattern that wraps dlt's REST API source as Dagster assets.
    """
    pipeline = dlt.pipeline(...)  # Direct pipeline control
    pokemon_source = rest_api_source(...)  # Declarative REST config
```

**Characteristics**

- **Architecture**: Lightweight Dagster wrapper around dlt's REST API source
- **Control Level**: Medium (pipeline config exposed, resources hidden)
  - **dlt**: EL is heavily declarative
  - **Dagster**: Metadata/Dependencies are explicitly configured 


**Pros**

- Quick implementation, less LOC, 
- Automatic pagination/handling via dlt's REST source
- Good for REST API ingestion that has good, best-practice structure
  - Allows for high leverage of dlt's built-in capabilities/utilities 
- Decoupling of dlt and dagster  
- Easier to integrate `@dg.asset_check`'s

**Cons**

- Opaque resource relationships
- Complex declarative configs can be hard to understand/follow
- Applying light, in-flight transformations during EL is not available
- Inflexible error handling (mostly handled by dlt)

---

### **2. Official dlt-Dagster Integration**

`2_poke_rest_apy.py`

```python
"""
Embedded ELT integration that auto-generates Dagster assets from dlt sources.
"""
@dlt_assets  # Auto-generated assets reduce boilerplate
def load_pokemon_2(...):
    # Opaque execution hides resource-level details
    yield from dlt.run(...) 
```

**Characteristics**

- **Architecture**: Coupled integration via `dagster-dlt`
- **Control Level**: Low (convention over configuration)
  - **dlt**: EL is heavily declarative
  - **Dagster**: 
    - Metadata: Auto-generated from dlt schema
    - Dependencies are  inferred from source

**Pros**

- Quickest to implement, shortest LOC
- Lowest development time
- Automatic asset key generation
- Can leverage dlt's built-in capabilities/utilities 

**Cons**

- Opaque resource relationships
- Complex declarative configs can be hard to understand/follow
- Applying light, in-flight transformations during EL is not available
- Inflexible error handling (mostly handled by dlt)
- Hard to debug pipeline steps
- Configuring and controlling metadata in Dagster is relatively more complex
  - For example, granular control of asset attributes requires a custom `CustomDagsterDltTranslator`
  - More Dagster overhead and abstractions to understand for configuration
- Migrating off Dagster requires changing and re-writing your dlt code (whereas the other two examples do not)

---

### **3. Custom dlt Resources + Dagster (Non-Integrated)**

`3_poke_rest_apy.py`

```python
"""
A hybrid approach combining manual API handling (with dlt loading) and wrapping with Dagster.
"""
@dlt.resource  # Explicit resource definition
def pokemon_resource():
    # Manual requests calls enable custom error handling
    response = requests.get(url, params={...})  

@dg.multi_asset  # Fully controlled asset outputs
def load_pokemon_data_3():
    # Explicit write disposition controls data refresh behavior
    pipeline.run(..., write_disposition="replace")  

```

**Characteristics**

- **Architecture**: Hybrid manual implementation
- **Control Level**: High (per- dlt resource tuning of code)
  - **dlt**: EL using `@dlt.resource` and `@dlt.source` allows for more control over EL
    - Code is less declarative
    - Easier to customize
  - **Dagster**: Metadata/Dependencies are explicitly configured 


**Pros**

- Every API call is explicit
  - Easier to to tune pipeline configs 
- Structure of code is easier to follow 
  -  Inline docstrings make documentation more approachable
- Most control over dlt EL and asset materialization metadata in Dagster 
- In-flight/lightweight transformation is possible
- Easier to integrate `@dg.asset_check`'s
- Decoupling of dlt and dagster 

**Cons**

- Needs more development time
- Higher maintenance overhead (lose some of the built-in capabilities/utilities of dlt)
  - Error handling is the developer
  - Manual pagination/retry logic
  - No automatic schema evolution
